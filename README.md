# nosave-server

This is a simple server for all your image processing tasks!

# What's different about it?

The difference is that this **server** doesn't save user's image on the _server end_ and still handles all your image processing.

# How to install?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prakharcode/nosave-server.git
cd nosave-server
virtualenv venv # if you use virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```
